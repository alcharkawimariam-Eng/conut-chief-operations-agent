## 🧠 Executive Summary

The **CONUT Chief Operations Agent** is an end-to-end intelligence system designed to transform fragmented F&B operational data into a unified strategic compass. Developed during the **AI Engineering Hackathon**, this system bridges the gap between raw POS logs and executive-level decision-making.

The system transforms structured operational data into:

📈 Revenue forecasting

🧩 Product combination insights

👥 Staffing pressure analysis

📍 Expansion feasibility evaluation

🗂 Unified branch-level intelligence export

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Multi-branch food and beverage businesses generate large volumes of transactional and operational data. However, most organizations lack:

* **Structured forecasting tools** to anticipate demand.
* **Data-driven combo optimization** to increase average order value.
* **Quantified staffing indicators** to balance labor costs.
* **Objective expansion scoring** for identifying the next location.
* **Unified branch-level intelligence** across disparate reports.

**This leads to:**
* Reactive decision-making.
* Missed growth opportunities.
* Operational inefficiencies.
* Underutilized data assets.


> **Goal:** Design a modular analytics engine that converts raw, report-style branch data into **Actionable JSON Intelligence.**

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

The project follows a layered, modular architecture designed for scalability:

1.  **Raw Data Ingestion:** Handling messy POS report exports.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Context-aware parsing and numeric normalization.
3.  **Model-Ready Structured Data:** Flattened, relational CSV formats.
4.  **Analytics Layer:** Independent modules for Forecasting, Combo Analysis, Staffing, and Expansion.
5.  **Structured Decision Outputs:** Final intelligence exported as JSON for agentic consumption.

Each analytics module operates independently but shares a common branch-centric design.

2️⃣ Feature Engineering

Branch-level operational metrics were created including:

- Daily revenue
- Transaction counts
- Product-level aggregation
- Customer-level purchase grouping

3️⃣ Model-Ready Datasets

Final structured datasets stored in: `data/prepared data/model_ready/`

These datasets are directly consumed by analytics modules.
